# Quay

[![Tests](https://github.com/itsactuallyluna9/Quay/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/itsactuallyluna9/Quay/actions/workflows/build_test.yml)

An implementation of Wharf in Swift.

## What is Wharf?

Wharf, according to it's specification, is a protocol that enables incremental uploads and downloads to keep software up-to-date. It's a cross between rsync and Steam, if that makes sense.

It tries to minimize network bandwith usage, assume as *little* as possible, and be open as possible.

## Why?

I was bored, and somewhat annoyed at the lack of documentation. (Seriously it's been 9 years... finish the spec!)
